## Database setup

```
$ brew install postgresql # install postegresql
$ psql postgres # connect to postgres database
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager # create a new bookmark_manager database
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager_test # create a new test database
postgres=# \c bookmark_manager      #connect to the database
```

### Connect to the bookmark_manager database

Once you create the database you should be automatically connected and see the below prompt - if not you will need to connect to it. You will to run a SQL script:
```
bookmark_manager=# \i 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql # This should include the full file path
```
